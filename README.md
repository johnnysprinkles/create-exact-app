A boilerplate generator, that scaffolds out an isomorphic multipage
Node/Express/React web app. Really all this does is clone the template,
[exact-template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exact-template).

Preview the result, hosted at http://exact.royalbarrel.com, which explains more
about the philosophy and motivation.

"Exact" is EXpress + reACT, for lack of a better name.

### To use

    npx create-exact-app my-app-name
    cd my-app-name
    npm run dev
    http://localhost:3000 in browser

### Features

* Basic Express setup
* Isomorphic page rendering
* Multipage support
* Organizational structure that can scale with a large teams
* Various demo pages that you can delete

The template distills what I've learned over several years of building
isomorphic multipage React apps at both FAANG and non-FAANG companies. Learn

[exact-template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exact-template) npm page.
